# Changelog

## What's Changed in 0.1.3
* feat: margins can now be strings eg. auto calc()
  

* fix: add 'none' containerType to core/group block
  

## What's Changed in 0.1.2
* fix: add server-side render for core/group block
  - added server-side rendering for the core/group block because I forgot
most people don't run headless WordPress and need to see their changes
on the frontend.

- generated a set of minified JS files for the block editor. This means
you can now use the plugin without needing to run a build step.

- refactored the build script to handle input/outputs a little better.

- added CSS input/output for the one stylesheet this plugin uses.

- added CHANGELOG.md


* feat: add size/spacing controls to button block
  - refactor: renamed `hide-inner-blocks-use-content-width.js` to
`hide-core-ui-elements.js` to add more general functionality

- refactor: changed TextControls to UnitControls so we can have things
like `px`, `%`, `em`, etc. in the controls.

- chore: cleaned up some leftover log outputs
