# Changelog

## What's Changed in 1.3.0

This release focuses on stability, responsive design, and a more usable Grid experience. It also completes a big internal refactor that makes the plugin safer and faster.

### For editors & designers

#### What's new
- **Responsive controls**: Set different styles for Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile. Switch device in the editor and you'll see the correct styles reflected.
- **Grid made simpler**: Two ways to place items:
  - *Simple*: pick where an item starts, and how many columns/rows it spans.
  - *Tracks*: fine control with start/end (supports named lines for advanced layouts).
- **Per-block style preview**: The editor now mirrors the selected breakpoint's styles more accurately—what you see is much closer to what visitors see.
- **Unsaved change indicator**: Grid panels show a small indicator when you've changed something and not saved yet (this will be rolled out everywhere in a future update).

#### Why it's better
- **Cleaner output**: Frontend CSS is printed once instead of inline styles scattered around, which helps performance and avoids “why does this look different here?” moments.

#### How to use the new bits
1) In the editor sidebar, choose Desktop / Tablet / Mobile.
2) Adjust your block’s styles (spacing, grid placement, alignment).
Those changes apply only to the active device unless you’ve set nothing yet (in which case it falls back from Desktop → Tablet → Mobile).
3) For Grid:
   - Use *Simple* for quick start/span.
   - Use *Tracks* when you need precision (named lines, explicit start/end).

#### Known limitation
- **Shrinking Grid Template Areas**: When reducing columns/rows from a parsed template, the grid can mis-shrink (e.g. 9×3 -> 9×1). This is being fixed in a follow-up.

### For developers

See [CHANGELOG-DEV.md](CHANGELOG-DEV.md) for API changes and technical notes.

## What's Changed in 1.1.1

#### Changes in 1.1.1

No new features, no bug fixes — just a licensing and contributor policy update to make this project more usable for more people. Costered Blocks is now dual-licensed under MIT and GPL-2.0-or-later. You can use either license as needed.

Why? Because some developers want permissive reuse, some want GPL continuity, and most of us just want tools that work without license anxiety.

#### Changes in 1.1.0

- feat: add Grid Controls panel to allow fine control over grid columns, rows, and gaps
- feat: add gap control to FlexBox Controls panel
- refactor!: migrate all 'mode' type attributes to use a new user preference store
- refactor: import attribute list from config into editor-style-mirror, avoids redundant attribute definitions
- refactor: rewrite entire icon handling system to reduce work needed when adding more icons
- refactor: separate hooks into individual files
- refactor: clean up file paths for hooks and filter for simpler file structure

*BREAKING CHANGE*: a lot of UI controls have alternate modes allowing more control over what
values are saved. previously these were stored as attributes such as "marginMode". These
are removed in favour of per-user preference store which is saved in the database and local
storage. This reduces attribute pollution.
