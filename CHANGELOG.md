# Changelog

## What's Changed in 0.1.1
* fix: add server-side render for core/group block
  - added server-side rendering for the core/group block because I forgot
most people don't run headless WordPress and need to see their changes
on the frontend.

- generated a set of minified JS files for the block editor. This means
you can now use the plugin without needing to run a build step.

- refactored the build script to handle input/outputs a little better.

- added CSS input/output for the one stylesheet this plugin uses.

- updated CHANGELOG.md
